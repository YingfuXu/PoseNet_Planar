# PoseNet_Planar
In this project, we investigate efficient small-sized convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for ego-motion estimation of micro air vehicles (MAVs) equipped with a downward-facing camera and inertial measurement unit (IMU), especially focusing on the robustness of estimation in fast maneuvers.

We greatly thanks Ir. Nilay Y. Sheth (https://github.com/nilay994) for his supports in developing the quadrotor MAV with GPU and collecting the flight datasets. We also appreciate the author of https://github.com/ClementPinard/FlowNetPytorch upon the code structure of which we developed our code for network training.
