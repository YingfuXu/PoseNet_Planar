# PoseNet_Planar
In this project, we investigate efficient small-sized convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for ego-motion estimation of micro air vehicles (MAVs) equipped with a downward-facing camera and inertial measurement unit (IMU), especially focusing on the robustness of estimation in fast maneuvers.
